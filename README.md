# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## [View Program in Action](https://youtu.be/yIQt0f0LfnE)

## Summary

This weeks challenge has us take some prewritten back end code, and initiate the objects, sync the server, finish up the routes, and create associations; all according to exacting specifications because this project simulates the finishing up of someone else's code. Instead of practicing creativity, this challenge is a study in adapability and following instructions.

## Usage

This program is meant to be run from the command line; you can then access the ports via Insomnia at this point. NOTE: this is *currently* ONLY THE BACKEND

## Testing

*api/categories*

{
    "category_name": "food"
}

*api/products*

{
    "product_name": "banana",
    "price": 2.00,
    "stock": 14,
    "tagIds": [1, 2, 3]
}

put:

{
      "price": 2500,
      "stock": 3,
     "tagIds": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}

*api/tags*

{
	"tag_name":"heybbbb",
	"productIds":[1]
}
